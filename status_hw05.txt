Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?

Nilay Barde


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/NilayBarde/memory


3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

http://memory2.bardenilay.com/


4. Is your game functionality complete, with the appropriate logic implemented
as server-side elixir code? If not, what's missing?

I was not able to complete the server-side elixir code to make the same game states appear with the same urls. I was able to get the board to be randomized using elixir rather than from the react file. 

5. Is your game properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

My game is properly deployed.
